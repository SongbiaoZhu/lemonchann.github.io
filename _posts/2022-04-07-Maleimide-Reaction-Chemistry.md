巯基马来酰亚胺反应是一种Click化学反应吗?

<!-- more -->



硫醇与马来酰亚胺快速反应生成硫代丁二酰亚胺(图1)是目前生物偶联中最常用的半胱氨酸残基定点修饰方法之一[[1\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn1)，[[2\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn2)虽然在某些条件下，巯基和马来酰亚胺基之间形成的硫醚键是缓慢可逆的(见下面的讨论)，但马来酰亚胺基团本身是相对稳定的[[3\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn3)，所以适宜于进行生物连接反应。

![Figure 1: The reaction between a free thiol and a maleimide produces a thiosuccinimide product. The process is a type of "click chemistry" reaction. On the left-hand side of the image, a free thiol (SH) group is shown with a maleimide group. In the center of the image, an arrow pointing from left to right has the word "click" in it to symbolize a click chemistry reaction. The final product on the right-hand side of the image shows that the maleimide group and the free thiol have reacted to form a thiosuccinimide product.](https://quantabiodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/Maleimide-Reaction-Chemistry-Figure1_v2.png)**Figure 1:** 游离硫醇与马来酰亚胺之间的反应产生硫代丁二酰亚胺产物。这个过程是一种“点击化学”反应。

## **巯基马来酰亚胺反应是Click化学反应吗?**

对这个问题的简短回答是，“是的，硫醇-马来酰亚胺反应是一种click化学反应。”具体来说，游离硫醇与马来酰亚胺基团之间的反应是一种加成反应，称为硫醇-迈克尔加成[[4\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn4) ，也称作硫醇-马来酰亚胺反应[[5\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn5). 许多科学家认为这个反应是一种“点击化学”反应，因为它符合Kolb, Finn和Sharpless定义的“点击化学”的大部分标准[[6\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn6) (Figure 2).

![Figure 2: What makes a reaction "click chemistry"? This slide, which is adapted from Reference 6, vide infra, lays out the criteria for click chemistry reactions as established by Kolb, Finn, and Sharpless.](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/Maleimide-Reaction-Chemistry-Figure2.png)**Figure 2:** 什么样的反应可以称为“点击化学” 6, *vide infra*.

## **巯基马来酰亚胺反应的机理是什么?**

Figure 3 shows the  general mechanism of the thiol-maleimide reaction. Figure 1 of reference 5 below contains a more detailed reaction scheme. The reason for the  high reactivity of the olefin is due primarily to *(a)* the ring strain arising from the bond angle distortion and *(b)* the positioning of the carbonyl groups in the *cis*-conformation. Indeed, in highly polar solvents such as water, dimethyl sulfoxide  (DMSO), N,N’-dimethylformamide (DMF), or N,N’-dimethylacetamide (DMAC),  the thiol-maleimide reaction proceeds without a catalyst, because the  polar solvent forms the thiolate ion, which is the active species for  the reaction.4

![Figure 3: Simplified general mechanism of the thiol-maleimide reaction, which is a specific type of Michael addition reaction.](https://quantabiodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/Maleimide-Reaction-Chemistry-Figure3-1024x248.png)**Figure 3:** Simplified general mechanism of the thiol-maleimide reaction, which is a specific type of Michael addition reaction.

From pH 6.5 to pH 7.5,  the thiol-maleimide reaction is chemoselective for thiols. At pH 7.0,  the reaction rate of maleimide with thiols is about 1,000 times faster  than the reaction rate of maleimide with amines. However, above pH 7.5,  free primary amines react competitively with thiols at the maleimide C=C bond (Figure 3).1

![Figure 4: The thiol-maleimide reaction. (a) The reaction is chemoselective for thiols from pH 6.5 - 7.5. (b) Above, pH 7.5, thiol chemoselectivity is lost and the maleimide moiety begins reacting with free amines (e.g., lysine).](https://quantabiodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/Maleimide-Reaction-Chemistry-Figure4-1024x640.png)**Figure 4:** The thiol-maleimide reaction. **(a)** The reaction is chemoselective for thiols from pH 6.5 – 7.5. **(b)** Above pH 7.5, thiol chemoselectivity is lost, and the maleimide moiety begins reacting with free amines (*e.g.*, lysine).

In aqueous solution, the  maleimide ring can be opened by hydrolysis (Figure 5). This  susceptibility to hydrolysis increases with increasing pH. Importantly,  if the ring-opening reaction occurs before thiolation, the resultant  maleic amide is unreactive to thiols. On the other hand, if thiolation  has occurred, the ring-opened succinamic acid thioether is stable.  Because of the propensity for ring-opening hydrolysis and inactivation,  we at Quanta BioDesign do not recommend aqueous storage for products  containing a maleimide, which is intended for future reactions. If  solution storage is required, use a dry, water-miscible, biocompatible  solvent such as DMSO, DMF, or DMAC (see below for more information).

![Figure 5: The reactions of thiol and maleimide. See the text for a complete description of these reactions.](https://quantabiodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/Maleimide-Reaction-Chemistry-Figure5-1024x503.png)**Figure 5:** The reactions of thiol and maleimide. See the text for a complete description of these reactions.

As shown in the top left  portion of Figure 5, the thiosuccinimide product can undergo a  retro-Michael reaction to regenerate the maleimide. The reformed  maleimide is then free to react with the same or a different thiol. *In vivo,* this retro-Michael reaction can lead to so-called “payload migration,”  as shown by the exchange reaction in Figure 5 on the lower right-hand  side.[[7\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn7) Research into payload migration and the stability of thiosuccinimide  groups on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has shown that the stability  of the thiosuccinimide ring depends on the site of conjugation on the  antibody[[8\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn8),[[9\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn9). The reformed maleimide can then react with other serum proteins such as serum albumin, causing the payload to exert off-target effects. The  thiosuccinimide ring should be hydrolyzed after the conjugation reaction and workup of the conjugated product to avoid payload migration when  using the thiol-maleimide conjugation.[[10\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn10),[[11\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn11),[[12\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn12),[[13\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn13),[[14\]](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/maleimide-reaction-chemistry/#_edn14)

In contrast, the [thiol-bromoacetamide reaction](https://www.quantabiodesign.com/bromoacetyl-reaction-chemistry/) leads to a stable thioether product that is not as susceptible to the  reverse reaction as the thiol-maleimide conjugation reaction. However,  the thiol-bromoacetamide reaction is slower and requires a higher pH to  proceed. Furthermore, it is not as chemoselective as the thiol-maleimide reaction.

## **Working with Maleimide-Containing Products in Thiol-Maleimide Reactions**

Quanta BioDesign’s maleimide-containing dPEG® products are easy to use effectively following our recommended  instructions on the product information sheets that are included with  every order. The following are some recommended best practices for  working with our maleimide-containing dPEG® products.

- Products should be  stored at the recommended temperature except when in use. The  recommended storage temperature for almost all products that contain  maleimide is -20°C.
- When a product  containing maleimide is removed from storage, it should be allowed to  equilibrate fully to ambient temperature before opening the bottle or  vial in which the product is stored.
- Aqueous solutions of  maleimide-containing products should be made immediately before use. If  the maleimide functional group is to be reacted, the pH should be 6.5 –  7.5, and preferably as low as possible within that range.
- Aqueous buffers and  organic solutions of maleimide-containing products should be free of  primary and secondary amines and free of thiols. If a base needs to be  used in a reaction with a maleimide-containing product, we recommend a  highly hindered organic base such as 2,6-lutidine ([CAS number 108-48-5](http://www.commonchemistry.org/ChemicalDetail.aspx?ref=108-48-5); [EC number 203-587-3](https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.003.262)).
- Do not store  maleimide-containing products in aqueous solutions due to the risk of  hydrolysis. Instead, use a dry, biocompatible, water-miscible solvent (*g.,* DMSO, DMF, or DMAC) for the long-term storage of these compounds. These solvents can be dried suitably over 3 Å molecular sieves (8×12 mesh  recommended) for 24 – 48 hours at 20 – 25°C. Solubilized  maleimide-containing products should be stored at -20°C. Quanta  BioDesign does not have information on the stability of  maleimide-containing products stored in solution because we explicitly  do not recommend such storage for these products.
- When conjugating a  maleimide containing product to a protein, if a stock solution of the  maleimide-containing product in an organic solvent (*vide supra*) is added to the reaction mixture, no more than 10% of the final  reaction volume should be the organic solvent, while the rest of the  volume should be water or aqueous buffer (for example, [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate-buffered_saline)). Some sensitive proteins may require that the amount of organic solvent be much less than 10% of the final reaction volume.
